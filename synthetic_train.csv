10001,re : quarterly planning update,"team,

following up on yesterday’s strategy session, i put together a summary of the key action items
and timelines that we agreed upon for the q2 planning cycle. please review carefully and add any
missing components so we can finalize before monday.

1. marketing demand forecasts will be updated by sara and raj using the revised pricing index.
   expected delivery: friday noon.
2. operations will complete the review of gas transport capacity under different load scenarios.
   tom mentioned the pipeline constraints at hub east need special consideration.
3. legal will prepare an outline for the revised supplier contract templates. major changes include:
      - new flexibility clauses on interruptible volumes
      - documentation of emissions reporting
      - preliminary renewable integration terms
4. finance requires full breakdown of hedging costs for the california exposure book. we should
   prepare sensitivity tables covering +/- 15% price moves.

let’s regroup friday at 3 pm to consolidate everything into the draft deck. if anyone becomes
blocked or needs historical figures from prior quarters, reach out and i’ll pull archives.

thanks again everyone for the progress so far.

10003,re : invoice reconciliation,"laura,

i reviewed the discrepancy on invoice #77182 from the september gas delivery. the mismatch
appears to come from an outdated tariff multiplier used in line 7. the scheduler confirmed
the correct rate should be 0.00347 rather than 0.00322. when applied across the full volume,
the billing difference aligns closely to the 3.8% variation finance flagged last week.

i recommend we send a corrected statement to the vendor along with a copy of the pipeline
receipt logs so they can verify independently. if they push back, we can escalate to supply.
let me know if you’d like me to draft the formal adjustment request.

10004,fw : procurement follow-up,"team,

attaching extended notes from the procurement alignment call with petra energy yesterday.
they are requesting longer-term hedging options indexed to the clean spark spread rather
than fixed basis pricing. some highlights from the call:

- client expects rising summer loads due to data center expansion
- emphasis on flexible take-or-pay clauses  
- interest in renewable PPAs if schedule certainty is guaranteed  
- risk concerns around congestion pricing in ERCOT north  

we agreed to model three illustrative structures for them by month-end:
   (1) fixed strip with quarterly re-openers
   (2) hybrid product with optionality band
   (3) swap+call spread overlay for volatility damping

we’ll need risk’s approval before presenting. please add any modelling assumptions into the
sensitivity sheet so we avoid mismatches between teams.

thanks,

10005,internal memo – storage strategy,"colleagues,

here is a rough draft of our internal memo about the seasonal storage strategy. the idea is to
capture value when winter volatility peaks by maintaining moderate injection positions through
october while layering in collars during shoulder months.

historical analysis from the past 7 years shows an average uplift of 12% when storage is paired
with covered calls under high backwardation cycles. however, we must consider counterparty credit
exposure if winter prices collapse unexpectedly.

feedback welcome before distribution to senior leadership.

10006,update : IT infrastructure roadmap,"hello team,

after two infrastructure audits and several interviews with application owners, we now have a
clearer view of the upgrade roadmap. the legacy job scheduler is being phased out next quarter,
and the data lake migration will begin in march, starting with archival logs before we touch
real-time trading streams.

the cybersecurity scan also revealed outdated certificates in three edge nodes. remediation is
underway and should complete within the week. please notify your teams to test connectivity after
patch rollout. downtime is expected to be minimal but not zero.

full documentation is now available on confluence.

thanks,

10007,project alpha sprint summary,"team,

10010,fw : storage request from scheduling,"scheduling asks if we can provide updated inventory projections through april. the duct firing
maintenance shift reduced daily withdrawal capability slightly. they want to rerun dispatch
